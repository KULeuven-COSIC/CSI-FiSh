To build with default parameters, simply run "make".

The build may be configured with other arguments:

- BITS is one of the supported parameter sets.
- UINT_IMPL is an unsigned integer implementation.
- FP_IMPL is a finite field implementation.

For example,

    make BITS=1024

builds the code with a 1024-bit parameter set, and

    make UINT_IMPL=uint.c FP_IMPL=fp.c

uses generic C arithmetic instead of assembly.


Other parameter sets may be used by creating a
directory modelled after the p512/ and p1024/
folders, optionally including specialized uint.s
and fp.s files for assembly arithmetic.  Else
the generic C implementation will be used.


To build the benchmark code, run "make bench"; it
also supports the arguments listed above.
To configure benchmarking, use the following options:

- BENCH_ITS is the number of iterations.
- BENCH_VAL benchmarks public-key validation.
- BENCH_ACT benchmarks the group action.

For example,

    make bench BENCH_ITS=1000 BENCH_ACT=1 BENCH_VAL=0

builds a benchmark for 1000 iterations of the group
action without public-key validation.
